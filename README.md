Easily build a next generation web application using microfrontends. Piral enables you to create a modular frontend application that is extended at runtime with decoupled modules called *pilets* leveraging a **microfrontend architecture**.

A pilet can be **developed independently** and ships with the necessary code, as well as all other relevant assets. Pilets are as independent of the host application as you want them to be - making them transferrable between different applications.

This makes Piral an ideal foundation for a mid-sized to large-scale applications developed by **distributed teams**.

:zap: A pilet is capable of dynamically **extending other pilets** or using such extension slots itself.

:zap: A pilet can provide or use **shared dependencies** from other pilets.

:zap: A pilet is **isolated** (developed and handled) and will never destroy your application.

:zap: A pilet can be developed with **any technology** using a **standard IDE**.

:zap: A pilet can be updated and **published within seconds**.

:zap: A pilet can be rolled out or disabled dynamically to create **self-forming applications**.

:zap: A pilet can be **debugged seamlessly** just as if you write a monolith.
